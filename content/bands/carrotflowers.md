Inspired by the sparse and raw delivery of indie stars The White Stripes and Royal Blood, The Carrot Flowers are a two piece rock band from Middleboro, Massachusetts. Guitarist Jake Hebert and drummer Adam Vitali met through a mutual friend and instantly connected through their joy of alternative rock and folk artists.

The Carrot Flowers, consisting of guitarist Jake Hebert and drummer Adam Vitali, met through mutual friend and visual artist Alyssa Asci. Having both been raised in the South Shore they bonded over niche bands, having musical dads, and the experience of growing up in a home with an autistic sibling. They both found music to be a strong outlet of expression during their youth which developed into the love of writing songs.

Even though they have separate solo releases that would be placed under the umbrella of indie folk, together their songs are driven by dirty guitar riffs and drum beats combining blues, punk, and rock with a touch of vocal harmony.

The pair have shared two releases together as The Carrot Flowers. A self-titled EP released in 2022 and their first LP “Green Flags” in 2023. “Other Things On Your Mind,” their newest single, will be available on all streaming services on February 29th and is the first of three songs leading up to the release of their new record “ A Time Will Come.”

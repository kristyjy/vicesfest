The Roscoes are an indie/alternative garage rock band branching from Boston, MA & Manchester, UK. As childhood friends they resided in the basement writing with inspiration of 60s rock/psychedelic until their lead singer Christian Hatfield made his move to the UK at a very young age. For years, the Roscoes became an item in the north of England with new members accompanying Hatfield until Covid-19 forced Hatfield back to his home in Boston. He brought
back his years of English immersion into his writing, resulting in angry/matured poetry prioritizing wordplay of the struggles that was witnessed by the ‘average Joe’. They tell tales of the common outlets the majority find to emotionally survive and stay in ensemble through hardships of the world crafted against them. Their diverse songs have been described as punchy, bouncy, hard hitting, ballad-esq and puts you through the very ups and downs we face
cognitively throughout our day to day in the 21st century.

A high-energy rock band based out of the Maine/NH Seacoast region, Noise on Neptune was
established in 2018 when former Sun Rise Red guitarist/vocalist, James Antonino &amp; drummer,
Jamie Eschmann (formerly of Sun Rise Red and Boring Kind of Guy) reconnected to record
unfinished work and a handful of new songs James had written in the years since Sun Rise Red
disbanded.

While James was comfortable taking over bass duties in the studio, they knew they would need
to get someone else to record the lead guitar tracks. The first and obvious choice was to
contact former Sun Rise Red lead guitarist, Jordan Bible. When he expressed interest, the guys
regrouped and within a matter of a few short months, they had achieved the goal of recording
a pile of demos.

... But they were really just getting started...

It was at that time that the guys decided to find an official bass player so they take their new
songs to the stage. The search was short-lived as they quickly recruited bassist, Jeff Vezeau
(formerly of Two Sided Season and Maniacal) and got to work on a new batch of demos while
practicing their set list rigorously and religiously.

Then came Covid, and along with a number of other commitments, Jamie was no longer able to
dedicate the necessary time to the band and decided to part ways. Not to be discouraged,
James, Jeff and Jordan continued working on their music while looking for a new drummer. 
It was spring of 2021 when James happened to reconnect with an old childhood friend &amp; front-
man, Madison West (formerly of Catastrophic OK &amp; Police Take Notice.) Madison had a new
song he was working on and asked James if he&#39;d work on it in the studio with him. The two
connected and in a matter of hours, they were sitting on a song that they both couldn&#39;t wait to
share. James, recognizing Madison&#39;s undeniable talent, shared some of the Noise on Neptune
songs and asked Madison if he had interest in joining the band. Madison could hear their voices
working together and told James that not only was he interested, but he knew a drummer, too.
The following week, the five guys got together and jammed. It was chemistry from the first
note. That summer, Noise on Neptune wrote and recorded over a dozen new songs before
making the difficult decision to part ways with the drummer for personal reasons. This was the
beginning of what would ultimately test the grit and perseverance of the band as they struggled
to find the right drummer. Between the fall of 2021 and summer of 2023, Noise on Neptune
went through three more drummers before arriving full circle and landing back on the OG
drummer, Jamie Eschmann, who was back and “all-in.”

Noise on Neptune can best be described as an oddball mix of Alice in Chains, Guns N&#39; Roses and
Blink 182. The band relies heavily on simplicity, reflective lyrical content, melody and
harmonies.

Night Fury is a Latina-fronted glam punk band based in Philadelphia. The band is a song-driven project that combines the theatricality of glam with the rawness of punk. The band comprises Nat Fury, Paul Severe, John Scho & Travis John. Their new album, 'Go Wild', came out last November and is now available on all music streaming platforms.

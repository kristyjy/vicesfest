Forged in the Mount Washington Valley in 2018 out of boredom two cousins, Cody and Trever, set out to make the most mediocre punk band the world has ever seen!!! Joined by their 3rd cousin (Eric) and a stray puppy (Brad) The Lazy Anarchists were born. With their fun nature and energetic stage presence you will have a blast. So get your dancing shoes on and prepared to be whelmed.

With membahs from Boston, NH, and RI, Ragz to Stitchez is New Englands Premier Punk Rockabilly band! Best described as old school punk rock with a 50s rock n roll theme. With hit songs such "Erectile Dysfunction" and "Boohoo Suzy" , there is a little something for everyone to enjoy. Fun for the whole family!

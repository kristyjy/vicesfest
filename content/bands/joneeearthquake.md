A black pirate hat and pair of mismatched Chuck Taylor high tops, one red and one green, often chording a vintage Japanese guitar or pedal steel - yep, Jonee Earthquake has a certain style. Taking folk surf, rockability and punk as inspirations, Earthquake put them all in a jar, screwed on the top and shook it until out poured a volcanic potion. His band is now a trio, simply for the simplicity, with his backup players rotating eaily from a vast pool of former members. If you should catch him as he persistently tours the state and region, tell him we said "Arrg."

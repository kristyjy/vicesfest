The Beatdown Kids are two or more geeks from Frye Island, Maine located in the middle of Sebago Lake. With their mega offbeat songs like "Living Large in Momma's Basement" and "I'm 62 Cents short of a Half Dollar Blues'', they are ready to entertain your Grandpa's 96th birthday or at a Taco Bell drive thru. If you like The Beatles you won't like them but if you like songs that sound like nothing else then yes, you might like them.

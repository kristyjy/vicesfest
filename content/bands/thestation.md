The Station is a group of five native Portland, Maine musicians  that present a unique blend of Pop Punk, Metal, and Alternative Rock.  Self-described as “Heavy Alternative PowerPop”, The Station’s sound has a  little bit of everything for any fan of rock music. Fronted by vocal  powerhouse Laura Cowie, this band’s energetic live performances are not to be missed. After originally starting as a cover band and selling out their first show at Portland House of Music and Events, the band quickly changed gears and began writing their debut EP in the winter of 2022. The "Up From Here" EP was released on August 18th 2023 and displays the band's intentional balance of heavy, poppy, angsty and occasionally beautiful songwriting.
